# bloctesting_demo

A new Flutter project, that demonstrates bloc implementation.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I have practiced 2 examples to learn Bloc implementation

- A simple app that picks random names from stream ot string to show how Cubits work as Bloc is
  made on top of Cubits.
- An App that can load various JSON files and display them. [Bloc is similar to Redux; Reducers are inside the Bloc itself.]
- --dev bloc_test (testing packages will only available on developers system), making code testable
